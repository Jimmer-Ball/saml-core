# Properties file holding the mapping between the Northgate internal code and
# a SAML entity identifier string which a customer may send in their SAML assertions
# and in their SAML metadata, and which we may send in any outbound SAML we would
# deliver for using some other service provider's services when identifying our own
# SAML details.
#
# The Issuer field is used to identify a SAML entity (either a service provider or an
# identity provider) in SAML metadata or responses/assertions to the wider web.  An
# example of a valid entity identifier might be the URL https://someidentityprovider.com
# used by some customer and its federation infrastructure.
#
# The SAML entity identifier details format can be one of a subset of the types defined
# in section 8.3:Name Identifier Format Identifier of the document
# http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf, so either
# format "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.0:nameid-format:unspecified" or format
# "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity".  It is this last format
# type "entity" that is the norm for the wider web in terms of identifying
# SAML entities.
#
# Internally within Northgate, we use a unique customer code to match up a customer's
# SAML requests to their configuration for routing to applications, so we need to be
# able to lookup an internal customer code given the customer's external SAML entity
# issuer details.
#
# Internally within Northgate, we can keep a mapping between our own internal product
# codes (like say myview) and a SAML entity identifier, if we need to send SAML to
# any third party that demands we send the entity identifier (expressed in the Issuer
# field) as a full SAML URL.
#
# For day to day purposes, if you know a customer will be sending SAML metadata and
# SAML assertions containing a full SAML entity URL in the Issuer field rather than
# using the internal Northgate customer code we've given them, then we will need to
# translate from the entity identifier they send us to their Northgate customer code
# to allow us to route to the right instances of the services within hosting. So, make
# sure you add a mapping between the entity URL used for the Issuer field and the
# internal Northgate customer code here.
