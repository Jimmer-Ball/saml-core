<p>This package is the entry point to the standard implementation and any bespoke implementations we might
    provide for customers wishing to make use of the SAML middleware project.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The package holds the basic factory classes that is invoked by different customer entry points (servlets) to
    provide bespoke or default to the standard implementations of assertion consumer processors, assertion producer
    processors, metadata handlers, and audit message handler classes at the SAML middleware. It also holds some
    vanilla standard consumer and producer classes for those who do not want to bespoke SAML processing</p>


<p>As a developer if your customer wants to access a service that already has a known assertion processing ingress point
    (so, say myview/consumer/servlet/SAML11AssertionConsumerService or
    myview/consumer/servlet/SAML2AssertionConsumerServlet)
    and doesn't need to do anything special in terms of inbound assertion processing or auditing, then you won't need to
    add any customer specific subdirectory here and can use the standard SAML2AssertionConsumer and
    SAML11AssertionConsumer
    All (I say all, but its still a bit of work) that is needed is to make sure hosting can commission the new customer
    by ensuring they have routing setup for that customer in saml.properties in the hosting network environment, and
    by making sure hosting have a new metadata entry for the customer as expected with an exchange of trust in terms
    of the customer giving us their entity descriptor and us giving them ours for the given service they want to access.
    See http://confluence/display/SOAStrategy/SAMLAssertion+Processing for more details on the exchange of trust
    information using SAML meta-data.</p>

<p>But, if your customer wants to send us a custom content assertion, or wants auditing to work differently for
    themselves, then you will need to create a subdirectory holding all their custom code at the middleware. If you
    stick to the package structure within the project standard, so see the sub-directory <i>standard</i> then you
    should be able to compartmentalise their code under <b>one</b> sub-package location instead of spraying it around
    the moddleware's code base.</p>

<p>You may even be able to put completely bespoke authentication validation (assertion processing) code under here.
    Witness the sub-package <i>ga</i> at the middleware which holds custom cross-domain authentication validation
    code for Goldman Sachs that doesn't use SAML, but instead uses a shared Message Authentication Code (MAC)
    generation algorithm based on a shared secrey key. The sky is the limit, <b>but</b> the middleware is meant to
    hold <b>only</b> cross-domain authentication code, and its supporting classes and nothing more. So if you are
    unsure of what to do, ask james.ball@ngahr.com and I'll be happy to help.</p>
