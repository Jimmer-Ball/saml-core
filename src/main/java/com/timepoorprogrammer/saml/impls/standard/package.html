<p>This package holds the standard/base/default implementations for any SAML component that could be bespoked.  The
bespoking mechanism relies on customer specific packages living at the same level as this package which provide
bespoke implementations of consumer processors, producer processors, servlets, metadata handlers, and
AuditMessengers.</p>
<p>All code for a given customer should be maintained under a single entry point subdirectory whose name corresponds to the
lower-case value of the official customer/partner/service code used by the hosting team.  This way all bespoke
assertion handling code lives in one place for one customer and all bespoke implementations match up to
the naming convention already in use within the company.  For details on how the factory classes work in terms of
providing bespoke code, go look at the multitude of Factory classes in package com.northgatearinso.saml.impls</p>
