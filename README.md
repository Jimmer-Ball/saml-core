This library produces and consumes both SAML 1.1 and SAML2 assertions.

You can embedd the library in your application to build SAML assertions
both encrypted and signed, using SAML meta-data as your guide in terms
of integration.

Please check it out, and run the tests to get an idea of how library really
works.
